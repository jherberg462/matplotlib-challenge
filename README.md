# The majority of drugs do not decrease cancer volume

The majority (7 of 9 drugs) did not reduce the volume of cancer found in the mice. These drugs did not appear to reduce the growth in the cancer meaningfully. This means the majority of drugs tested will be a failure. 

#There were mice deaths even in cases when the cancer volume declined

All drugs resulted in the deaths of some of the mice, even those that successfully reduced the amount of cancer found in each mouse. This means that none of these drugs will outright cure cancer.
